# Customer Churn Prediction for GNB Bank

**1. Project Overview:**

The Customer Churn Prediction project for GNB Bank aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict customer churn. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers discontinue their services, is a critical concern for GNB Bank. The project delves into a comprehensive analysis of customer data, explores key features affecting churn, builds predictive models, and provides actionable insights to optimize customer retention strategies.

**2. Business Context:**

Understanding and mitigating customer churn holds paramount significance for GNB Bank. It directly impacts the bank's revenue and operational costs. By preventing customer churn, GNB Bank can reduce customer acquisition expenses and maintain long-term profitability. Moreover, enhancing customer retention cultivates a positive brand image and sustains competitive advantage in the dynamic financial industry.

**3. Problem Statement:**

The core challenge is to develop a reliable predictive model capable of identifying customers who are likely to churn. This predictive power will enable GNB Bank to allocate resources effectively, tailor strategies for at-risk customers, and implement initiatives that foster customer loyalty.

**4. Objectives:**

   **a)** Analyze historical customer data to uncover patterns and insights.
   **b)** Develop accurate predictive models to anticipate customer churn.
   **c)** Identify key factors influencing churn behavior.
   **d)** Deliver actionable recommendations to enhance customer retention.
   
**5. Data and Methodology:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

The project commences with exploratory analysis to comprehend the dataset's structure and characteristics. EDA helps reveal trends, patterns, and potential correlations among features.

**Data Preprocessing:** Missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and features are scaled for consistent model performance.

**Feature Importance Analysis:** Utilizing SHAP values, the project identifies influential features contributing to customer churn. This step unveils critical insights into customer behavior.

**Model Building and Evaluation:** Multiple models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, are developed and evaluated. Metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC are used to gauge model performance.

**Interpretation and Recommendations:** The model outcomes are interpreted to extract actionable insights. The project provides specific recommendations for GNB Bank to implement targeted strategies and interventions for at-risk customers.

**6. Conclusion and Impact:**

By predicting customer churn accurately, GNB Bank can proactively address potential churners and tailor retention strategies. This will lead to increased customer satisfaction, improved brand loyalty, and enhanced profitability. The project's insights will equip GNB Bank with data-driven decision-making capabilities, ensuring a stronger competitive edge in the financial industry.

**7. Dataset Overview:**

The dataset contains 9970 rows and 14 columns, encompassing a variety of customer attributes. Features include credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card ownership, active membership status, estimated salary, and the target variable 'Exited,' indicating customer churn.

**8. Future Enhancements:**

Future iterations of this project could involve more advanced techniques, such as ensemble methods and deep learning, to further enhance churn prediction accuracy. Additionally, integrating external data sources and real-time feedback loops could provide richer insights for continuous improvement of customer retention strategies.
